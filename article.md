# AI Agents – Creating a Shopping Agent using Amazon Bedrock AgentCore and Strands Agents Python SDK

## Introduction

TBD - in this article I will show how to create a shopping agent using Strands Agents Python SDK that will be hosted in
Amazon Bedrock AgentCore. Agent will have access to a simplified Products Catalog and Order Management System that will
allow agent to create orders on user behalf. It will be possible to execute agent both locally and on AWS.
